            <p><strong>Krave Beauty</strong> Krave Beauty is one of my all time favorite skincare brands <br>
              Krave Beauty focuses on "less is more" and reseting your skin barrier after using harsh skincare products <br></p>
            

            <p><strong>Paula's Choice 10% Azelaic Acid Booster</strong> <br>
              Azelaic Acid is one of my essential skin care products for when I have breakouts or redness. This product has helped tone down the redness of breakouts and quickly clear up small breakouts! <br>

            <p><strong> Soon Jung Hydro Barrier Cream</strong> <br>
              I've been using this for 2 years and it is a solid moisturizer that is good for my sensitive skin. It's not too heavy, but it's also very hydrating.

            <p><strong> Ordinary Hylaronic Acid 2% and B5</strong> <br>
                This is a great and affordable Hylaronoic Acid! My skin gets very dehydrated during the winter, so this gives my skin an extra boost of hydration. <br> Rating: &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088</p>

            <p><strong>Supergoop's Unseen Suncreen</strong> <br>
              This is by far my favorite facial sunscreen out there. The Unsceen Sunscreen leaves no white cast and is great for my sensitive skin (it's also a great makeup primer). <br> Rating: &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088
