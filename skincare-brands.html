            <p> Here are 9 of my favorite skincare brands :) </p>

        <div class="brand-gallery">
            <img id="pic1" src="images/krave-beauty.jpeg" alt="Krave Beauty skincare products"/>
            <p><strong>KRAVE BEAUTY</strong> Krave Beauty is one of my all time favorite skincare brands <br>
              Krave Beauty focuses on "less is more" and reseting your skin barrier after using harsh skincare products <br></p>
            

            <p><strong>THE ORDINARY</strong> <br>
              I love the Ordinary because their products are simple, affordable, and effective. </p>
            <img id="pic2" src="images/ordinary-brand.jpeg" alt="A variety of the ordinary products"/>

            <img id="pic3" src="images/brand-soonjung.jpeg" alt="Soon Jung Products"/>
            <p><strong> Soon Jung </strong> <br> I discovered this brand while looking for a daily moisturizer two years ago. I love their products and they're perfect for sensitive skin types. This will always be one of my holy grail brands. If you're looking for something simple and hydrating then this is the brand for you. 
            </p>
            
            <p><strong> PEACH AND LILLY</strong> <br>
                Peach and Lilly is a Korean skincare brand that has many products to give you a glass skin look that I haven't been able to find before. </p>
            <img id="pic4" src="images/brands-peach.webp" alt="An assortment of skincare products from Peach and Lilly"/>

            <img id="pic5" src="images/brands-paula.jpeg" alt="An assortment of skincare products from Paula's Choice"/>
            <p><strong>PAULA'S CHOICE</strong> <br>
               I've also been using this brand for a while! I have acne-prone skin so Paula's Choice 2% BHA Exfoliant helps me out. My favorite products from Paula's Choice are the 2% BHA Exfoliant and the 10% Azelaic Acid.
            </p>

            <p><strong>CERAVE</strong> <br>
              CeraVe is one of those skincare brands that I always come back to when my skin just needs something simple. CeraVe is a reliable and affordable brand I can count on.
            </p>

            <img id="pic7" src="images/brands-sleep.jpeg" alt="A cartoon of a purple sky and moon"/>
            <p><strong>SLEEP</strong> <br>
              Throughout my years of trying different products to solve my skin problems, I realized that sleep is very important. When I don't get enough sleep, it's very noticable in my skin (I look like a zombie). Although there are many great products out there that I love, getting more sleep may help you with some of your skin concerns. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>DRINK WATER</strong> <br>
                Drinking water isn't a skincare brand, but it's one of the best things you can do for your skin. Staying hydrated leaves your skin plump and glowy. I can always notice a good difference in my skin on days where I drink enough water &#x2665;

            <img id="pic9" src="images/relax.jpeg" alt="Cartoon girl sitting on a chair relaxing"/>
            <p><strong>RELAX</strong> <br>
              I'm still working on this one. No matter what products I use, if I am stressed my skin will freak out. My skin when I am relaxed vs. stressed out is like day and night. After finals week or a stressful week in general, my skin looks rejuvenated compared to the stressful week.
