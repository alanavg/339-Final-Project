          <h1> A little bit about me</h1>
          <p> My name is Alana Vang and I love everything skincare (even when my skin doesn't cooperate) :)</p>
          <img src="images/skincare-outline.png">
          <p> I've always been one to struggle with acne-prone and dehydrated skin. My skincare journey started out with watching YouTube tutorials and buying whatever product I found at the store in a desperate attempt to help my skin. Many years later, I learned that the products you use depend on your skin type and that I was being too harsh with my skin. I am still learning more about my own skin and how to give it love, but here is what I've learned throughout the years. </p>

            <p><strong>Youth to the People Kale and Green Tea Spinach Vitamins Facial Cleanser </strong> <br>
              This is my current favorite face wash! I've been using this for about 2 years and leaves my face not dried out while feeling clean. <br> Rating: &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088</p>

            <p><strong>Paula's Choice 10% Azelaic Acid Booster</strong> <br>
              Azelaic Acid is one of my essential skin care products for when I have breakouts or redness. This product has helped tone down the redness of breakouts and quickly clear up small breakouts! <br>

            <p><strong> Soon Jung Hydro Barrier Cream</strong> <br>
              I've been using this for 2 years and it is a solid moisturizer that is good for my sensitive skin. It's not too heavy, but it's also very hydrating.

            <p><strong> Ordinary Hylaronic Acid 2% and B5</strong> <br>
                This is a great and affordable Hylaronoic Acid! My skin gets very dehydrated during the winter, so this gives my skin an extra boost of hydration. <br> Rating: &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088</p>

            <img src="images/supergoop.jpeg" alt="Supergoop's Unseen Suncreen"/>
            <p><strong>Supergoop's Unseen Suncreen</strong> <br>
              This is by far my favorite facial sunscreen out there. The Unsceen Sunscreen leaves no white cast and is great for my sensitive skin (it's also a great makeup primer). <br> Rating: &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088 &#11088
